Description:

Customized the dataset for fitting the Linear Regression. 

Main dataset contains 22 columns and 307 rows. 

After customization the dataset contain 6 columns and 307 rows.  Columns are height, weight, BMI, gender, area and age.  Gender, area and age are the 
categorical variables of of our dataset. We have chosen four models from our dataset.These models are:

Model-1: BMI =β0+β1*(1/weight)+β2*(height)^2+β3*ln⁡(age)+β4*area

Model-2:ln⁡(BMI)=β0+β1*(weight)+β2*(height)^2+β3*age+β4*ln⁡(age)^2

Model-3: BMI=β0+β1*(height)^2+β2*(weight)

Model-4: ln⁡(BMI)=β0+β1*ln(height)+β2*ln(weight)+β3*ln⁡(age)+β4*ln⁡(gender)+β5*ln⁡(Residence)

We have improved the R^2 value from previous model to next model.

We found the R^2 value of BMI column.
